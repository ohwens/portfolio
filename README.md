**This is Version 1 of my Portfolio. Over the next weeks and months, I expect this page to undergo significant design changes.


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

** My name, photo, and links to various sections can be found on the page.

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

** The navigation links automatically scroll the page to the specified section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

** The work link scrolls to the Work section of the page

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

** The application image is an active link to the application itself

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

** Currently, only the first image is an interactive link to another page. The other iamges are just placeholders until I have more content to share.

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

** The page automatically adjusts based upon the width of the viewport
